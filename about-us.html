His childhood was marked by many outdoor adventures and a strong connection to nature. However, one particularly warm summer, everything changed.</p>
                        <p class="hero-body article-grid-body">Wildfires ravaged the forests Owen loved. Suddenly, climate change wasnâ€™t about future dangers; it was a clear and present danger that Owen felt with every smoke-filled breath.</p>
                        <p class="hero-body article-grid-body">This experience ignited a spark within Owen, prompting him to consider what he could do to ensure a sustainable future. Drawing inspiration from his passion for design, he recognized that to address climate change and environmental concerns, it was important for businesses to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprints.</p>
